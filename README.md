Hey there! This program scans text sounds and removes the noises fo animals you know of!
To work this program press run (obviously) and paste code formatted like this (without the parentheses):

2 (number of recordings you have)
toot woof wa ow ow ow pa blub blub pa toot pa blub pa pa ow pow toot (the recording sounds)
toot woof wa ow ow ow pa blub blub pa toot pa blub pa pa ow pow toot 
dog goes woof (which animal makes what noise, ___ goes ___)
fish goes blub
elephant goes toot
seal goes ow
what does the fox say? (end it with this, my program will catch the fox word and automatically run)

As for who cares about this, I'm unsure, who converts audio clips into text anyway
